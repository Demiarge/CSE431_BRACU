## <span style="color: #2ecc71;">About This Course</span>

CSE 431 Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides an introduction to the field of natural language processingâ€”the creation of computer programs that can understand, generate, and learn natural language. The topics include the three major subfields of NLP: syntax (the structure of an utterance), semantics (the truth-functional meaning of an utterance), and pragmatics/discourse (the context-dependent meaning of an utterance). The course will introduce both knowledge-based and statistical methods for NLP and will illustrate the use of such methods in a variety of text- and speech-based application areas.
